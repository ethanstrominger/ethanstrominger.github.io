<p>In 2017, after 19 years at Oracle, I decided to take time off to try new things. Since then, I have taught classes,
    ran a user group for Test Driven Development, presented at user groups and conferences, did some solo open source
    programming, and did programming as a volunteer for Code for Boston.
</p>
<p>
    I found that programming with others brought me the most joy. in April 2020, I completed a three-month, 700 hour
    software engineering immersive program to bring my skills up to date. This was one of the best three months of my
    life. More about that here (??? link to come).
</p>
<p>
    Based on these experiences, I am going to do a combination of coding on consulting, volunteer open source
    programming, and instructing.  If you are passionate about pair programming, test driven development, or other practices that foster rock-solid,
    maintainable, and extensible code, letâ€™s talk. I would love to discuss whether my passion, knowledge, and technical
    companies would benefit your project.
